icoast
======
iCoast is a PHP based web application designed to harness the power of "crowdsourcing" to compare coastal imagery from both before and after 
extreme weather events. Noted changes are recorded using predefined tags and the data is then used to help ground truth and improve 
existing predictive change models.

iCoast is live and can be found at:
